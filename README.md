# Web-Scraper-Safe-Home
Python tool to find the safest and most affordable places to stay at while attending college.

**Introduction**

The purpose of our tool 'Safe Home' is to be able to find the safest and most affordable places to stay at while you are attending college. The problem that we are trying to solve is that students have to spend a lot of time on multiple websites before deciding on preferable areas to stay when theyâ€™re attending college. International Students especially have a problem with this as it is particularly difficult to assess the safety of a place remotely.

Safe Home scrapes data from multiple crime and real estate websites to determine the safety and pricing of houses in an area.

**User Views**

The user will be able to access the following major views:
1.	Type and severity of crimes for different areas in college towns
2.	Housing prices for different types of houses in these areas

**Instructions to use the tool**

The following python libraries have to be installed using pip install <library name> before you can run the code.
The libraries are:
pandas
matplotlib
selenium
BeautifulSoup

To run the program, run the main.py file.
The other files are called as modules in the main file.
